## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.3.2 with React 19
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.0
- **Language**: TypeScript 5
- **File Processing**: xlsx for Excel files, pdf-parse for PDFs
- **HTTP Client**: Axios for API requests
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API (optional, with fallback recommendations)

```

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```env
# Optional: OpenAI API key for enhanced recommendations
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Optional: Ollama endpoint for local LLM (fallback)
OLLAMA_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:11434
```

### Data Configuration
The application uses several configuration files in the `static/` directory:

- **Customer data**: Upload via Excel/CSV with columns for customer name, location, products
- **Regional pricing**: Configured in API routes (`src/app/api/map-customer-region/route.ts`)
- **Lab consumption profiles**: Defined in the same API route file

## üöÄ Deployment

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Docker Deployment
Create a `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

COPY . .
RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

Build and run:
```bash
docker build -t aws-cost-platform .
docker run -p 3000:3000 aws-cost-platform
```

### Vercel Deployment
1. Connect your repository to Vercel
2. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard
3. Deploy automatically on git push

### AWS/Cloud Deployment
For enterprise deployment on AWS:
1. Use AWS Amplify for automatic deployments
2. Or deploy to EC2 with Load Balancer
3. Configure CloudFront for global CDN
4. Set up RDS for customer data persistence (optional enhancement)

## üìä Data Requirements

### Customer List Format
Excel/CSV file with columns:
- **Customer Name** (required)
- **Location** (city, state/country)
- **Products** (comma-separated list)
- **Bed Count** (for hospitals)
- **Lab Types** (optional)

### Example:
```csv
Customer Name,Location,Products,Bed Count,Lab Types
General Hospital,Boston MA,Product A,Product B,350,Core Lab,Pathology Lab
Research Labs Inc,San Francisco CA,Product C,Product D,,Molecular Lab
```

## üîí Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- Customer data is processed locally and not permanently stored
- No sensitive data is sent to external APIs (except optional OpenAI for recommendations)
- All uploaded files are processed in-memory and cleared after analysis

### Access Control
For enterprise deployment, consider adding:
- User authentication (NextAuth.js)
- Role-based access control
- Audit logging
- Rate limiting

## ü§ù Customization

### Adding New AWS Regions
1. Update `regionalMultipliers` in `src/app/api/map-customer-region/route.ts`
2. Add region to dropdown in forecast pages

### Adding New Lab Types
1. Update `labBaselineCosts` in API routes
2. Add to available options in UI components
3. Update consumption profiles as needed

### Modifying Cost Calculations
- Core calculation logic is in `src/app/api/map-customer-region/route.ts`
- Regional benchmarking in `performBenchmarkAnalysis()` function
- Forecasting algorithms in forecast page components

## üìà Monitoring & Analytics

### Performance Monitoring
- Next.js built-in performance monitoring
- Consider adding Vercel Analytics or Google Analytics
- Monitor API response times and error rates

### Usage Analytics
- Track popular features and user flows
- Monitor file upload success rates
- Analyze forecast accuracy over time

## üÜò Support & Maintenance

### Common Issues
1. **File upload failures**: Check file format and size limits
2. **Calculation errors**: Verify customer data format
3. **Performance issues**: Monitor bundle size and optimize imports

### Updates & Maintenance
- Regularly update dependencies for security patches
- Review and update regional pricing multipliers
- Enhance AI recommendations based on user feedback
